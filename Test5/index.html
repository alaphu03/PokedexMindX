            <div>The Pokédex (ポケモン図鑑 Pokemon Zukan) is an electronic device designed to catalogue and provide information regarding the various species of Pokémon featured in the Pokémon video game, anime and manga series. The name Pokédex is a neologism including "Pokémon" (which itself is a portmanteau of "pocket" and "monster") and "index". The Japanese name is simply "Pokémon Encyclopedia", and it can feature every Pokémon on it, depending on the Pokédex.</div>
            <li><h2>National Pokedex</h2></li>
            <div>The National Pokédex (Japanese: 全国図鑑 national illustrated encyclopedia) is a Pokédex that has been upgraded with the National Mode (Japanese: 全国版 National Edition) that records information on all Pokémon known to exist, instead of just ones native in a particular region. The National Pokédex is not available at the start of the games, but it can be unlocked by completing certain tasks.</div>
